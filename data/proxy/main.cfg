# some guides also mention `sv_listingIpOverride`, this value is only needed if the server list backend
# can't guess the IP to query itself, and is not provided to any front-end connection.

# this is usually the case for systems with multiple IPs, or if the server is firewalled off for all hosts except
# a server proxy.
